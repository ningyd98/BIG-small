| Repository | Description |
|---|---|
| **graspclutter6dAPI** | Dataset toolkit — annotation loading, grasp evaluation **(this repo)** |
| [gc6d-pose-anno](https://github.com/SeungBack/gc6d-pose-anno) | 6D object pose annotation tool (BOP format) |
| [gc6d-contact-graspnet](https://github.com/SeungBack/gc6d-contact-graspnet) | 6-DoF grasp detection baseline |

- Load and manipulate 6D grasp pose annotations
- Perform grasp evaluation for benchmarking
- Maintain compatibility with [graspnetAPI](https://github.com/graspnet/graspnetAPI) from GraspNet-1B

## Dataset

The GraspClutter6D Dataset is available through [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GraspClutter6D/graspclutter6d)

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from source (Recommended for latest version)

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n gc6d python=3.8
conda activate gc6d

# Clone repository and install in development mode
pip install git+https://github.com/seungback/graspnetAPI.git
```

### Option 2: Install via pip (Deprecated)

```bash
pip install graspclutter6dAPI
```

## Environment Setup

Before running the examples, set the environment variable to point to your dataset location:

```bash
export GC6D_ROOT='/path/to/graspclutter6d'
```

## Usage Examples

### Validate Dataset Integrity

Check if the downloaded dataset is complete and properly structured:

```bash
python examples/exam_check_data.py
```

### Load Grasp Annotations

Load and process grasp annotations from the GraspClutter6D dataset:

```bash
python examples/exam_loadGrasp.py
```

### Visualize Grasp Annotations

Generate visualizations of grasp poses and objects:

```bash
python examples/exam_vis.py
```
